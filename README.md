# Linux (GUI) Setup Script

Linux setup script for fresh installs of GUI distros (e.g. Ubuntu, linux Mint, ect...).

> If you use Windows, see [Win-Setup](https://github.com/hmerritt/win10-setup)

## How to use

Do not run the individual scripts in `./src` directly! - they are compiled using [hmerritt/combine-script](https://github.com/hmerritt/combine-script) into one script that can be run.
